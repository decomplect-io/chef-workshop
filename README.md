Hello Folks -

We have one day to learn Chef. To make the most of our time it's best
that we all read this carefully. Please ensure that you install all the required software. We will NOT spend time on installation during the workshop.

## What are the pre-requisites to take this workshop?
- You must have some exposure to deploying or developing a Rails application.
- Some command line exposure will be very handy.

## What software do I need to install?
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- `git clone https://github.com/decomplect-io/chef-workshop.git`
- `cd chef-workshop`
- `vagrant up` [this will take some time. Please run this command on a decent internet connection and be patient!]
